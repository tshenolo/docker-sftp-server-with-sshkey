## Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of Docker and SFTP.
- Git is also required to clone the repository.
- Basic knowledge of command-line operations.

## Quick Start
### SSH Key Configuration  
Generate SSH¬†Key: If you do not already have an SSH key pair, you can generate one using the following command:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" -f $HOME/.ssh/docker_rsa
```

Ensure your private key (~/.ssh/docker_rsa) is kept secure with the appropriate permissions:
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/docker_rsa
```

Load your SSH key into the SSH agent by running:
```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/docker_rsa
```

### Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tshenolo/docker-sftp-server-with-sshkey.git
```

Change your current working directory to the newly cloned repository:
```bash
cd docker-sftp-server-with-sshkey
```

To ensure SSH key-based authentication for your SFTP server, place your SSH public key into the working directory:
```bash
cp $HOME/.ssh/docker_rsa.pub .
```


### Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t my-sftp-server .
```

### Run the Docker container:  
To run your SFTP server container without data persistence, you might use a command like this:
```bash
docker run -d --name my_sftp_container -p 2222:22 my-sftp-server
```

To ensure that uploaded files are not lost when the container stops or is removed, you should persist data by mapping a directory from your host machine to a directory inside the container
```bash
docker run -d -v /local/sftp/upload:/home/sftpuser/sftp/upload --name my_sftp_container -p 2222:22 my-sftp-server
```

### Connecting to the SFTP¬†Server
Connect to your SFTP server using:
```bash
sftp -oPort=2222 sftpuser@localhost
```

## Conclusion
This project simplifies the deployment of a secure SFTP server using Docker. By leveraging Docker's capabilities, you can ensure data persistence, enhance security, and customize configurations to suit your needs.
